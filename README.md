# test

This is a simple test app getting data from network to practice a tad bit.

## Start

Nothing fancy, no CocoaPods, just clone and run!

## Architecture

Just MVC and repository pattern, to face things like massive view controllers so that I can really know why iOS developers are choosing MVVM, VIPER, and other stuff.

## Other things

- Supports iOS >= 12.1
- Supports iPhone and iPad (portrait and landscape)
- Built using UIKit
- Uses CoreData
- Uses the JSONPlaceholder API
